Hi!
I finished freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design recently and decided to take Frontend Mentor challenges as practice.

As you probably can tell by reading the code, I still have a long way to go.

In the project I used Flexbox to center the tile, I had some issues with the bigger screen width, but I would say
that I did an ok job with the more mobile like ones.

I did the project in VSCode, mostly guided by the Live Preview extension, and I think that due to 
my lack of knowledge about it I struggled to make the design work for larger screen sizes.
